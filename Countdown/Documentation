When executing the countdown program, the program starts at 0 and continues increasing until it reaches 2000000. In order to obtain the secret message at 2 million I used radare to reverse engineer the executable. I first found the address where the loop allowing the countdown was located. I then changed the jump if greater than operation to a jump if less than operation. The jump if greater than operation compared the current number to 2000000 and jumped to the final message if the condition was satisfied. Changing the initial jump operation to a jle operation allowed me to bypass the counting process and display the final message. The final message was "Present the following key to GOOD: Live not on evil.".
